Cloud + data platforms lead value — Snowflake ($113k, 37 jobs), Azure ($111k, 34), AWS ($108k), and BigQuery (~$110k) show strong demand with above-average pay.
Core tools still dominate demand — Python (236 jobs), Tableau (230), and R (148) are the most in-demand skills, but pay is mid-range (~$99k–$101k), meaning they’re baseline requirements.
Engineering + big data boosts salary — Skills like Go ($115k), Hadoop ($113k), Spark ($99k), and Java ($107k) show higher pay when analysts move closer to engineering and scalable data systems.
